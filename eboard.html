                            <p>Hi guys! My name is Harshita Das, and I am a Computer Science
                                major with minors in Environmental and Sustainability Studies and
                                Women's and Gender Studies. As President, I would like to continue
                                our principle of creating an inclusive environment for our members
                                and providing them with professional, educational, and personal
                                opportunities to grow and learn during their college lives. Prior
                                to being President, I was Outreach Chair 2017-18 and Outreach
                                Coordinator 2016-17, and apart from WIC, I am Treasurer Phi Sigma
                                Pi â€“ Beta Sigma and Service Chair for Tau Beta Pi.</p>
                            <p>Before college, I had no coding experience, but I always wanted to try it. So I took an
                                intro to coding class on campus, and because I enjoyed it so much,
                                I decided to major in it. I enjoy Computer Science because I like
                                problem solving, which I believe is a big part of our major since our
                                classes (and careers!) revolve around creating solutions for real world problems.
                                Aspects of CSE that interest me are data analysis, algorithm engineering, and
                                metrics visualizations. Some of my favorite classes ever are HST 150 (World History
                                After 1500), CSE 431 (Algorithm Engineering), and ANP 330 (Race and Ethnicity, and
                                Nation). I am glad I came to MSU for my degree because there are so many opportunities
                                on campus to grow and develop both personally and professionally, and there
                                are always people there to help you if you need it. Hope to see you at our next meeting!

                            <p>Hi friends! I'm Sasha, and I'm super excited to be this year's WIC Vice President!
                                I have been involved with WIC since the Kick-Off Meeting my freshman year and love to
                                see new faces at our meetings. I have previously served as our Social Events Chair and
                                enjoyed spending my free time volunteering at WIC outreach events.</p>
                            <p>In my role as Vice President, I am responsible for coordinating attendance for over 20
                                women to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing. This conference is
                                a great opportunity for students to hear from influential women in technology, network
                                with companies, and learn about new technologies. I also coordinate MSU WIC's attendance
                                at MICWIC, a spring conference for women from Michigan to learn more about technology.
                                I'm very happy to be able to help out our President whenever she needs an extra hand
                                this year!</p>
                            <p>I think technology is amazing, and I am so excited to be in a major where the career
                                opportunities are seemingly endless. I've interned in both Michigan and New York,
                                working on web applications and big data. This year, I am focusing on learning more
                                about mobile apps and keeping up with the ever-changing technology field.</p>
                            <p>Please feel free to send me an email if you have any questions about WIC!</p>

                            <p>Hannah is a second year student majoring in Computer Science.
                                She has been programming since her sophomore year of high school
                                and loves that coding gives her the power to solve complex problems
                                in a direct and logical manner. She is thankful for the fun and
                                supportive community of WIC and especially that it gave her
                                the opportunity to become a Girls Who Code mentor. She is excited
                                to be serving as Community Relations Chair this year and that it'll
                                allow her to meet new people and make new friends through WIC.</p>

            <h2>WIC Extra Mile Leadership Award</h2>
            <p>The WIC Extra Mile Leadership Award is given each year to a member of the WIC Executive Board whose
                outstanding leadership in the last year has contributed towards improving the club.
                The WIC President and WIC Vice President nominate an awardee, who must be approved by the WIC Advisors.
                The WIC President, WIC Vice President, previous EMLA recipients, and students
                who could graduate in the current academic year are ineligible. The purpose of the award is to recognize

                in the coming years.</p>
