                    WIC participates in various outreach events throughout the school
                    year, including Girls Who Code, STEM Day, Introduce a Girl to
                    Engineering, and a series of STEM nights and Career Days hosted in
                    the East Lansing/Lansing Area. Many of our events are oriented
                    towards minimizing the gender gap in Computer Science and other STEM
                    fields. Any WIC members interested in participating in outreach
                    events are welcome to sign up during WIC’s general meetings or by
                    contacting our outreach chair.

                    <p>
                        Girls Who Code is a national program to promote women’s
                        representation in computing. Michigan State University founded its
                        own Girls Who Code club in Spring 2018. WIC members who
                        participate in the program become mentors to middle school and
                        high school-aged girls from Lansing Area schools. Students have
                        the opportunity to learn about women in computing-related fields
                        as well as how to code. Please stay tuned as Girls Who Code
                        lessons will begin in the spring.

                        in which hundreds of K-4th grade students come to Michigan State
                        to learn about STEM fields. WIC participants help lead the
                        students through hands-on, computing activities and teach the
                        students about Computer Science. STEM Day will be held on
