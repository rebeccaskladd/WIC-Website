        <h2>The GHC Experience from a CommArts Student</h2>
        <p class="news-author">Jessica Lam, WIC Member</p>
        <p class="news-date">October 2, 2018</p>
        <img class="news-img" src="../assets/images/2018-2019/ghc_jessica.jpg">
        <p>Going to the Grace Hopper Celebration was an experience that made me more
            proud to be a woman in the tech industry. I learned a lot about historical
            figures like, Grace Hopper or Ada Lovelace’s contributions to technology.
            I also learned that there were many similarities from my past classes to the
            speaker sessions that I attended.</p>
        <p>As a Media and Information major, that is interested in Front-end Design and
            User Experience, I found that going to this conference brought up things I have
            learned in my CSE classes and my MI classes. At one of the speaker sessions,
            I learned about accessibility in the products people build and how there should
            be more of it. My biggest takeaway from the session was “Accessibility
            drives innovation.” I never thought about it that way but it makes sense
            to me. If someone was having a hard time doing something, there has to be
            someone else to step up and try to fix it. Companies need to try to put
            more effort into creating more accessible products and including people with
            accessibilities on their teams.</p>

        <p class="news-img-sub">"Bringing the *Personal* Back to Branding" speaker, Rebecca Andersen</p>
        <p>In my past Media and Information classes, I learned that an elevator pitch should
            be something that should be a conversation rather than just a statement that you say
            to introduce yourself. This was also something I listened to a speaker talk about at
            the conference about personal branding. I tried to do that as much as I could while I
            was at this conference at the career fair. It felt good to have an organic conversation
            instead of having a scripted line that I would just say. I can admit that for the first
            few encounters with companies that I had that elevator pitch line, but I always felt so
            stuck and awkward at the end of it. Having the conversation rather than a line just
            to say during the career fair was good practice.</p>
        <p>I planned on going to the Grace Hopper Celebration to learn as much as I could and
            talk to as many companies as I could that intrigued me. It was a really good time to
            network with random people that were also standing in line waiting for the speaker
            sessions, and it was also surprising at some points to see that the people of my past
            were there too. I hope to keep on maintaining the new contacts that I have and continuing
            to try to make a difference in the tech industry by making the step to being in it.
            My biggest piece of advice to future people that go to Grace Hopper is to have a
            conversation with future companies and be proud that you are a woman in tech.</p>
