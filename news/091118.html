        <h2>"Leaning-In" with WIC at Kick-Off!</h2>
        <p class="news-author">Sarah Johanknecht, 2018-2019 WIC Lean In Chair</p>
        <p class="news-date">September 11, 2018</p>
        <img class="news-img" src="../assets/images/2018-2019/leanin-kickoff2018.JPG">
        <p>WIC kicked off the 2018 school year by welcoming
            50+ girls (and guys!) to their first Lean-In meeting of the year.
            Lean-In Circles, an idea coined by Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook,
            have been a staple of WIC meetings for about three years now, occurring
            monthly.</p>
        <p>These circles are formed by networks of women across the country with
            the idea of empowering each other to reach their dreams! They provide
            a community for women to meet, share thoughts and struggles, grow with
            each other, and learn from each other.
            <p>WIC’s Lean-In kickoff meeting started with an introduction to the
                club by President Harshita Das, followed by E-Board introductions, and
                of course, lots of pizza! The meeting then moved into an icebreaker:
                Lean-In Bingo. This was an activity where attendees got to interact and
                engage with each other, trying to fill out their bingo sheets with interests
                and fun facts about others in the room. Switching gears, participants then
                listened to a TED Talk by Sheryl Sandberg on why there are too few women
                leaders in the world today. Keeping the video in mind, small group discussions
                kicked off talking about topics like why sitting at the table is important and
                how to take advantage of opportunities. These discussions flowed into the last
                part of the meeting, where all participants decided on an “action item” to take
                before the next Lean In Circle to encourage personal growth and confidence.
                <p>As Lean-In Chair, this meeting was so encouraging from start to finish. The room
                    was packed with students eager to learn and grow, and connect with others in technology.
                    I got to be part of some awesome conversations - from bonding over love of reality TV in
                    the icebreaker to discussing why we, as women, are less likely to raise our hand in class
                    or speak up in the middle of meetings, and how we can change that! I’m so excited to
                    welcome all of our participants back at the next Lean-In meeting and continue these
                    important conversations and connections throughout the rest of the year.</p>
