                <p>Michigan State University Women in Computing (MSU WIC) offers many ways for its members to connect
                    with each other and the community. This past year, WIC members attended conferences, supported each
                    other in Lean In circles and participated in outreach programs! As president, I enjoyed
                    participating and witnessing WIC evolve and grow to offer new opportunities to both current members
                    as well as to young girls in the community. This annual report highlights some of the opportunities
                    WIC participated in to increase membership and engage current members.</p>
                <p>MSU WIC is a community of women and men who are passionate not only about technology and computer
                    science, but also about increasing the number of women and other underrepresented groups in
                    technology. To foster and grow our community this year, we emphasized recruiting and retaining
                    first-and second-year students. Senior WIC members purposely engaged junior members at WIC meetings
                    and organized a meeting in which they advised junior members about courses. We believe that
                    establishing a strong support network early in a studentâ€™s college career aids the student in
                    successfully completing her chosen degree program.</p>
                <p>This academic year, MSU WIC members attended the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing
                    (GHC). Thanks to the financial support from industry partners and from the University, 27 MSU WIC
                    members attended GHC in Orlando, Florida. At GHC, MSU WIC members had the opportunity to network
                    with other women in computer science, attend tech talks on diverse topics within computer science,
                    and hear keynote speeches from inspirational women such as Melinda Gates and Dr. Ayanna Howard.</p>
                <p>In addition to supporting women and underrepresented groups interested in computing at the college
                    level, many MSU WIC members also participated in K-12 outreach programs. This year, MSU WIC created
                    the Spartan Girls Who Code Club, which is now home to over 40 students, 17 mentors and 2 Michigan
                    State University faculty members who serve as advisors. The students are from middle and high
                    schools in the surrounding areas, which is broken down into a junior club for students in grades 6-7
                    and a senior club for students in grades 8-11. The goal of the club is to expose students to the
                    foundations of programming and critical problem solving with the ultimate goal of not only
                    encouraging more females in STEM related fields, but also providing them with an empowering
                    community of women technologists. Not only were younger students exposed to computing topics and a
                    supportive environment, but MSU WIC members learned how to convey computer science topics in a
                    comprehensible manner by planning and executing lessons and activities. Many MSU WIC members also
                    served as volunteers for recruiting and outreach events hosted by the University.</p>
                <p>MSU WIC partnered with the following technology leaders in offering these opportunities to students:
                </p>
                <p><strong>Gold</strong>: GM | Vertafore | ASMSU</p>
                <p><strong>Silver</strong>: Target | Crowe Horwath | Dow Corning</p>
                <p><strong>Bronze</strong>: Blue Medora</p>
                <p>On behalf of MSU WIC, I would like to express our gratitude to all of our industry partners, the
                    Computer Science and Engineering Department, and the College of Engineering for their continued
                    support this year. There are not enough words to express how much their support impacts and improves
                    all of the programs and opportunities that MSU WIC offers its members. I would also like to thank
                    our alumni for helping WIC become what it is today. For our current and future members, I hope WIC
                    continues to be as significant to you as it was to me during my four years of college: a source of
                    friendship, support, and countless memories.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>Lauren Allswede</p>
